# The `inputs` folder: data inputs to the Congressional Districts estimation

Any files pull from an API or scraped will go here.
So, technically the "inputs" are themselves "outputs" of a data pulling
activity, but they are inputs to the congressional district level estimation.
Furthermore, the input data will be checked in to the repo so that the
district level estimation can proceed without the downloading activity

But at any time, the data pull to create the files in inputs can be run.
These scripts are in src/
