# Files
1. EnhancedCPS.h5: Will have the actual data except for the weights.
2. Weights.h5, the weights for every household, to provide estimates at the district, state and national levels
3. Geography.csv, which will have the names of the geographies. This is a decoder to tell what the weights are. Also, put in the x and y values in this file for plotting.
